  react-scripts start
  ```
- _prettier:_ format the files inside `src/` folder with the configuration set in `.prettierrc.json`
  ```
  npx prettier --write ./src
  ```
- _server:_ transpile the `main.ts` file to javascript, execute the generated `main.js` and format files
  ```
  tsc public/main.ts && node public/main.js && npm run prettier
  ```
- _min-server:_ execute `main.js` and format files
  ```
  node public/main.js && npm run prettier
  ```
- _build:_ transpile the `main.ts` file to javascript, execute the generated `main.js`, format files and do the build.
  ```

<!-- HOW DOES IT WORK -->
<div id="how-it-works"></div>

## ðŸ”¬ How does it work

All useful information for developers is explained here.

<!-- NETLIFY CMS CONFIG -->
<div id="NetlifyCMS-config"></div>

### Netlify CMS configuration

Netlify CMS stores all the content inside the repository, so no database is required. The configuration for it is located in `public/admin/` with:

- `index.html`: the display of Netlify CMS and [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/)
- and `config.yml` for the actual CMS.

The content required for this webpage is divided into 2 types:

- **Pages**: cannot be created or deleted, only modified. Corresponds to the supages the app has.
- **Components**: are totally reusable and CRUD operations can be made. Corresponds to all elements repeated throughout the app that have the same structure.

With that, the content generated in the CMS is saved into two separated folders.

- `src/content/pages/` for the pages with one subfolder per page. Each file is generated as `.json`.
- `content/` folder for components with one subfolder per collection. Each file is generated as `.json`.

<br>

> Note: it is important that there is one folder per collection (either page or component) so that the content of the entries (files) does not get mixed up.

<br>

<!-- DATA MANAGEMENT -->
<div id="data-management"></div>

### Data management (main.ts file)

Pages are automatically read as they are generated because they are created as [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-es.html) inside `src/content/pages/` folder. So they are imported and used in the required React components as the default.

For components, as there is one `.json` file for each component, it is necessary to group the content in a single file, the `main.ts` file has been created. This files does the following:

1. Reads all subfolders inside `content/` (matching CMS collections).
2. For each subfolder, reads the content of the files inside it (CMS entries).
3. Creates an id for each entry.
4. Sorts all entries extracted from all files by the generated id.
5. Creates a `.json` file with all the sorted entries and stores it in `src/content/{collection}` so that it can be imported in the app.
