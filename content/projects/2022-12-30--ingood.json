Reale embraced disruption going ahead with a complete digital product with other insurers. \n\nThe focus of the project was to promote the joy towards what really matters for the consumer, and meanwhile the new product would take care of their valuable belongings. The result was the creation of ingood, a new brand endorsed by the Reale Group but with its own and rich personality differentiating from the main brand."
