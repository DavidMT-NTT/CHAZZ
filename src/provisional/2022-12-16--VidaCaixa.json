  "body": "The banking and insurance sector faced changes: new taxation and less attractive returns on long-term savings, as well as the appearance of emerging new digital players, and challenging traditional players. On top of everything, consumers expect companies to offer them what they need immediately. \n\nVidaCaixa and Chazz collaborated to boost the experience of saving products, understanding the true meaning and psychology of savings and life insurance, to define the roadmap for action to face the changes, retain clients and transform the consumer's experience."
